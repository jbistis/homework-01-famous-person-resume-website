      Oliver Hilary Sambourne Messel (13 January 1904 â€“ 13 July 1978) was an English artist and one of the foremost stage designers of the 20th century.  He was 55 and at the peak of a career in which he had dazzled three decades of theatre-goers with his fantastic, romantic and inspired stage sets and costumes.  In 1959, Messel, exhausted by a demanding theatre season and recurring arthritis, retreated to Barbados and the lush beauty of the eastern Caribbean.  The warmth, colour and vibrancy of the tropics seemed to liberate new sources of energy and imagination, leading him to what would eventually become a whole new career in designing, building and transforming ordinary homes into wonderlands.  One lasting legacy is that his preferred light sage green shade of paint, now known as <samp>"Messel Green"</samp> by paint companies in the Caribbean, has been immortalized as many property owners choose this colour for its quintessential Caribbean-ness.
